### The Future. Going Crazy.

  * Demo X0: Resolve simple (well-known) tags from the filesystem level with online collections.
    Linked Open Data: like that.
    URL now stored right next to the String value.

  * Demo X1: Resolve subtitle textfiles to object graphs.

  * Demo X2: WikiBrains!
    * Resolve every Wikipedia article to Object graphs.
    * Literally word by word.
    * Link each word to its corresponding entry on Wikidata.
    * Compose indexer networks to crunch those graphs in semantic queries.
    * Connect that to an AI.
    * Hope we're good friends...

  * Demo X3: Resolve programming code textfiles into object graphs.
    Depicting object class structures onto the filesystem. 
    Code(=text) then becomes "potentially executable" (PE-)metadata. 
    Show compiler-flag demo implementation that compiles this kind of "filesystem-objectified" (FO-)Code.

  * Demo X4: A draft for *HTML42*
    Building on the assumption (and desire) to have AHFX-compatibility as native and widespread and "just working" like we enjoy the perceived seamlessness of our online-connections and experiences.
    HTML42 shall offer a similar improvement to all-things-online, by offering frameworks and standards where "Object
 handling" becomes even more seamlessly.
    And at the same time, web-and-app development and user-experience happily enjoy the most different environments - all engaging interoperably on the Object filesystem database level.
    Imagine an active website project (code) designed for an Object filesystem: All database actions would resolve into standard lib-queries, and since any design/code building block is now literally a filesystem "Object" that you can connect with others...

  * Demo X5: HTML42 and "pd".
    HTML42 could be used as initial language to describe the world as an ungraspably large Object Data Graph.
    Any data described in HTML42 could therefore be used as native (=fully compatible) input to any digital processing.
    HTML42 could possibly be edited best in a visual graph-editor - similar to "pure data" (PD).
