AHA: WhatIf this technology and usage was already "common default" and simply taken for granted on the majority of "finally" up-to-date machinery and setups.

Then I would start my first day of any computer or programming class like this:

P3:
Good morning :)
Yes, I still do ASCII.

B: Good morning.

P3:
Okay, the first thing to know about digital is that "Anything can be an Object, right?".
And on that level I introduce you to the Gray-Matter Object World:

Gray, because it's between Black and White.
Gray-Matter computing can in many cases easily be extended (gradually) to allow more shades of gray - being then able to represent whole spectral areas.

Sounds super-complicated and/or eso or youtubed - yes: What is "Data"?

Do you have "Data" somewhere?
Where?
Doesn't matter: You just search/find/favorite/history/ask your "IT"?

Exactly.

Back in the old days, there was an amazingly simple paradigm omnipresent:
"files in folders" (FIF) they called it.

Almost getting romantic thinking back to the days when we had to "choose sides".
Incredible how this simple digital metaphor re-arrangment, turned the whole world upside down in such a smooth and positive way: "Just do it all in Objects".

So I may now introduce you to the plain Data Object:

  * You can store data [unlimited]
  * You can store meta(data) [unlimited]

Okay, the "unlimited" Object is a variable to consider during runtime.


# Here's how we start: Hello World.

  1. Object "Hello World"
  2. Object ID (#DIA) is: "20231123-Hello World-01"
  3. Assign (select or copy/paste from Python tutorials) an Object Class definition to the types you need. You get a ready-made code-set (All related Objects) that you can simply refer to in your implementations.
  4. Make sure it has a method "fly()" or "grow()" or "doMagicTrick()": It's all just code.

continued:

  5. You search for "fly() method" in your "Object Space(s)". You may find a (signed/trusted) library that offers you access to these "Programming Code Objects".
They called these "executables". How dark and demeaning. Unimaginable today. I know.
Glad these "dark digit times" are over.

  6. So in any Object-aware environment, you should find the fly-and-grow methods in their "BIOS" collection.
  7. Since any library-Object comes with an Arch-inspired build-system, and kvm-and-browser-sandboxing: You can run anything anywhere. If any copy of a referred to Object exists "anywhere" in the accessible Object space, the Data can be used and interpreted.

## Long story short:

  * Right click: New.
  * Add Main method:
    * Search "Implement Hello World 101 DIA"
    * Result: A selection of community-and-self rated/weighted graph results that you can then further query or re-question, re-order.

Yes, you now have digital LEGO blocks.
This makes professional and private computing training great fun for everyone!
Finally, "school" may turn to "'s cool!" again.
Haha. ;)


# Okay, seriously: It "just works", but...

If I kept your understanding of digital and computing and data on that level of "search on the Intarweb, hope it's good - and believe it'll be with 'best intentions'"?

In today's Object-IT worlds, all source (code) was initially "invited" (=checked and patched) before a Library (yes paper and digital) decides to "support" (=host a copy) "IT", too.

Anyways:
It's common sense to "validate" your library Objects - and supply self-check code for your own works.

Back to "Hello World":


## Even longer story, almost as short:

   * Right click: New.
   * Edit New: main=echo("Hello World");
   * Save.
   * $> New.fly();

Yes, the easieast interface for *anyone* is the commandline interface for most operations - and GUIs enhancing the overall experience.

UIs are immediately usable directly from the original test-and-main developer's desks:
It's a copy of Object graphs - and over time, parts of their "related Objects" may be removed on purpose, or accidentially. This actually allows complex digital objects (or object-structures) to not break-by-single-bitflip, but rather gradually be either skimmed down, or kept "fat" - if not having to filter out any "overweight" data.

You can simply double-click the "fly()" method link. Anywhere.
Any link is just a reference to the actualy "Object" in the Object Spaces (you have access too).

Pretty simple, huh?


So: Right-click > New > main=type_code_here_or_refer_to_library - then use/study/share/improve on it - and hopefully save and re-use it with best intentions.

I may suggest to start with a common programming language first to see how it really "flies", and get to know each other - and then allow running any other lanuage the "Object Communites" consider worth keeping/supporting.

In any case, any pseudo-code syntax you can come up with, will most probably compile and make sense.
On GNU/Linux and FOSS environments.

Libraries were not so cool in the past, btw.
They were suuuper-rich-and-famous in the past before that (medieval and such) - and then only later became "the backbone of the modern digital age": Simply by providing "proper" access to "IT".

When you read the history books, it almost feels like they were re-written in the most kitsch-yet-science-faction utopian 80s movie script. A bunch of people - after 2020 - make "Libraries Digital" the most accessed web-services of all times since the beginning of the Darpa-Net, and its Science-Networks.


The fact that you can "just hello world" on anything these days (easter egg hint, btw) - is the best introduction to the Digital Object World that surrounds us for so long now.

There's so much out there, and you can simply USSI it.
