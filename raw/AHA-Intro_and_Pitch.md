  * Anything that runs on a unix-philosophy system, will trive with this.
  * Its design integrates seamlessly into the unix philosophy (and all systems built around it).
  * Could it become part of POSIX?
    (Quote [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX): "Many user-level
    programs, services, and utilities [...] were also standardized, along with
    required program-level services (including basic I/O: file, terminal, and
    network)"


# Pitch 20230816

  * Do you own, and handle digital objects?
  * How much do you believe, or rely on file- and foldernames?
  * Would you like to simply "tag" any data, anywhere, persistently, and in a way that you're familiar with?
  * As plain and simple as renaming a file or creating a new folder.
  * What if all necessary components for this already exists? And in FOSS!
  * How well do you find your "files"?
  * Ever used a web-search to find your own stuff?

I want a Holodeck. By August. AHA!
I want to put my meta where my data is!
And I want payload to be optional, and no difference between "with or without additional data".

Imagine you can tag, annotate, describe, relate, query, transform and anything: as basic as renaming a file, drag-n-dropping stuff from A to B, creating a new "target folder". All the same.

Who would like to have that?
I definitely do!


How?
Simple: Just agree to use the filesystem for any metadata.
Providing even better atomic-persistency than file- or foldernames.
Persistent enough to replace any embedded metadata.
To dissolve complicated (media) data container file formats into plain object graphs.

Your filesystem.
From SD-Card to large scale cluster: All the same.
Your tags go with their data - and all relationships and references along with it.
Recursion depth and fetch-rules freely choosable.

You can now "web-browse" all of your data.
From personal use to institutional and beyond.
Got any asset management systems in use? Cost saving?
A currently existing object filesystem can be used to build a prototype relatively easily.
Performance (and tuning) is intended to happen if the prototype seems useful.

The "AHA World" is designed to make the shift for data handling to the actual 21st century.
Bold? Well, all parts in code already exist, we just need to put them together and orchestrate its implementation.


Interested?
I certainly am.
Got time? Got funding? Got ideas?

Right.
I agree: I think that all software components are already existing - and stable in production use.
Yet, I also work on solving interoperability cases like import/export/conversion/inspection etc.
From what I see at my work, and also personal life and hobbies:
Handling "files" and digital projects and "assets" (especially over time), is still a daily challenge.

And a very expensive one, I guess.

  * How much do you believe, or rely on file- and foldernames?
  * Would you like to simply "tag" any data, anywhere? persistently, and in a way that you're familiar with?
  * As plain and simple as renaming a file or creating a new folder?
  * What if all necessary components for this already exists (and were licensed FOSS)?
  * How well do you find your "files", your "data" currently?
  * How easy and quick is it to organize your digital stuff and keep it "in order"?

> "If it's not nicely interoperable, and taken for granted, as well as stable

  * Whatif we could simply tag any digital object? Anywhere, anytime.
  * Whatif tagging digital objects would be as easy and native as "naming a file"?
  * Whatif describing, annotating (digital) objects would be as easy and native as naming a file and adding tags?
  * Whatif personal, professional - even large-scale supercomputing would have a common, fully-interoperable UX and feature design?
  * Whatif there was a thing as good as a StarTrek Holodeck - just a few years away, yet fully "real" (except for the photonic-mass part)?




# Pitch / Intro 20230813


## Imagine: Every digital thing is an object.

Literally.
Like a file. But not in a folder anymore.
There's just space. Like a pool.

Update (2024-01-18):
The terms "data lake" and "data pools" are already existing and describe data storage means that provide most of the technical means (and design) required to go for a meta-is-data implementation.


## Remarks:

  * More information on object ids and its intended "collision-friendlyness" can be found in: "[AHA-Features]()".
