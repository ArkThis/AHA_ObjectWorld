  * Anything that runs on a unix-philosophy system, will trive with this.
  * Its design integrates seamlessly into the unix philosophy (and all systems built around it).
  * Could it become part of POSIX?
    (Quote [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX): "Many user-level
    programs, services, and utilities [...] were also standardized, along with
    required program-level services (including basic I/O: file, terminal, and
    network)"


# Pitch 20230816

  * Do you own, and handle digital objects?
  * How much do you believe, or rely on file- and foldernames?
  * Would you like to simply "tag" any data, anywhere, persistently, and in a way that you're familiar with?
  * As plain and simple as renaming a file or creating a new folder.
  * What if all necessary components for this already exists? And in FOSS!
  * How well do you find your "files"?
  * Ever used a web-search to find your own stuff?

I want a Holodeck. By August. AHA!
I want to put my meta where my data is!
And I want payload to be optional, and no difference between "with or without additional data".

Imagine you can tag, annotate, describe, relate, query, transform and anything: as basic as renaming a file, drag-n-dropping stuff from A to B, creating a new "target folder". All the same.

Who would like to have that?
I definitely do!


How?
Simple: Just agree to use the filesystem for any metadata.
Providing even better atomic-persistency than file- or foldernames.
Persistent enough to replace any embedded metadata.
To dissolve complicated (media) data container file formats into plain object graphs.

Your filesystem.
From SD-Card to large scale cluster: All the same.
Your tags go with their data - and all relationships and references along with it.
Recursion depth and fetch-rules freely choosable.

You can now "web-browse" all of your data.
From personal use to institutional and beyond.
Got any asset management systems in use? Cost saving?
A currently existing object filesystem can be used to build a prototype relatively easily.
Performance (and tuning) is intended to happen if the prototype seems useful.

The "AHA World" is designed to make the shift for data handling to the actual 21st century.
Bold? Well, all parts in code already exist, we just need to put them together and orchestrate its implementation.


Interested?
I certainly am.
Got time? Got funding? Got ideas?

Right.
I agree: I think that all software components are already existing - and stable in production use.
Yet, I also work on solving interoperability cases like import/export/conversion/inspection etc.
From what I see at my work, and also personal life and hobbies:
Handling "files" and digital projects and "assets" (especially over time), is still a daily challenge.

And a very expensive one, I guess.

  * How much do you believe, or rely on file- and foldernames?
  * Would you like to simply "tag" any data, anywhere? persistently, and in a way that you're familiar with?
  * As plain and simple as renaming a file or creating a new folder?
  * What if all necessary components for this already exists (and were licensed FOSS)?
  * How well do you find your "files", your "data" currently?
  * How easy and quick is it to organize your digital stuff and keep it "in order"?

> "If it's not nicely interoperable, and taken for granted, as well as stable
> and reliable, and fun to have: It's not what I've meant in my design."

  * Whatif we could simply tag any digital object? Anywhere, anytime.
  * Whatif tagging digital objects would be as easy and native as "naming a file"?
  * Whatif describing, annotating (digital) objects would be as easy and native as naming a file and adding tags?
  * Whatif personal, professional - even large-scale supercomputing would have a common, fully-interoperable UX and feature design?
  * Whatif there was a thing as good as a StarTrek Holodeck - just a few years away, yet fully "real" (except for the photonic-mass part)?




# Pitch / Intro 20230813


## Imagine: Every digital thing is an object.

Literally.
Like a file. But not in a folder anymore.
There's just space. Like a pool.


## Remarks:

  * More information on object ids and its intended "collision-friendlyness" can be found in: "[AHA-Features]()".


## Pitching the idea

  * What if I told you, that I had an answer to positively affect your greatest wish?
  * What if I told you that "The Secret" simply can be implemente - immediately - for anyone "online": it's now a digital user choice ;)
  * Imagine I offered you a fresh, clean, clear and ready - and interoperable and persistent, etc - a common "commons" so simple -and fully digital.
  * By design: It's a new - yes, fully digital - world:
    Filled with objects that stand in any arbitrarily definable relationships to each other.
    Data objects.
  * There is no difference between metadata (small datasize) and data payload (large datasize, compared to eh plain text)
  * Now what I try to show to you is the following idea:
    * IF there's anything you would wish (for whatever - even for fun or bad day - anything)?
    * Is there anything you'd like to share and exchange with others? Digitally?
    * WhatIf you could phraase and manifest that exact good - great wish! - and release that as a simple
      "Digital Meta Object" (yes, shit I'm sorry - the naming collision with meta is awkward and creepy, but it would work so well)?
    * Short "DOs": "Digital MetaData Objects".
    * This all new filesystem can scale from as small (sd-card, usb-stick, local-only, folder-only, etc) to beyond-cloud-you-name-it-3000+ "Mega Compjutar!" of any kind. Or mobile devices, or any hardware, basically.
    * All you do is:
      Make a wish. Or wishes.
      Simply create digital objects that "represent" your wishes.
      Now "annotate" these wish-objects, by giving them your "attention". Your time and energy.
      In a good way.
      In any way you like.
      And now do just one thing differently than I'd assume is usual:

> **Simply assume for once, that it's actually gonna turn out just fine. pretty amazing. Continue.**


## Braindump

  * DOT: "The Object Dungeon" - too dark for my taste.
    However, I think it's best to assume that whatever this association stands for - maybe even just the simple letter character "."?
  * I'd rather not call it "dot net" - it'll just cause confusion, but:
  * Imagine 


## Wish-Objects:

Create an object space environment where it's "custom" to drop and implement "wish objects".

People put a lot of time and effort and resources into "commons" - nowadays it's "a thing" how much "users" spend with and on their digital equipment. Our literally digital life.

Why not make a wish?

If an AI should ever get lose, it'd be great if it'd pick up on this one and "fill in the blanks". With all its aquired abilities in the electro-digital parallel universe.

Let's see if there's a wish "out there" I could make happen today:
> "show me all wishes, that ..."

It's a very fuzzy idea.
Maybe this is not part of the AHA-world, but more a real social networking idea as "demo showcase" for this new AHA-world.
