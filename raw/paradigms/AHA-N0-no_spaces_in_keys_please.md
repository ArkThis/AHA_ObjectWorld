# No spaces in keys. Ever.

I promise.
You promise.
We all really really promise: NO SPACES IN KEYS.

`THAT_SERIOUS`

Because we know what spaces can do between letters...
We don't want this. Ever again.

No spaces in keys. Don't worry.
Everyone is with us here.

No spaces. In keys.
I know it's a "limit" in freedom of expression and so on, but no.
no spaces in key strings.
CamelCase, prefered over underscore (for byte-saving reasons).
Unicode UTF-8 support by default.

But NO SPACES.
`Alt+255` is probably okay.
Or be a joker and put a `Alt+7` there.
Or a plain good old emoji.


BUT NO SPA CE.
PL E A SE

...in keys.


Thank you.
Was it so hard? 😇️🌈️🌟️
We can continue happily now.


> Oh, btw: by "keys" I meant the strings of filesystem-object extended attribute key/value pairs of metadata.
