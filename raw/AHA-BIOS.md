# AHA BIOS support?

Would it make sense to implement AHFX-compatible basic features in a modern BIOS?
EFI specs would allow executable code?
Like provide certain name=value handling optimizations as high-level functions provided below the OS already?

If BIOS/EFI would allow booting from an Object Graph filesystem, allowing code to run on querying the OS-HDD-FS (AHFX-compatible). This would bring the AHA features to the operating system design - as a new paradigm option.
