## Keep everything: How to handle all that meta/data?

Good question.

With the question of "garbage collection" of metadata: I'm still not sure.

I don't think it's an either-or question.
I think it depends.
That's what my work-experience has shown me so far.

For starters, I must say I'm for "keep everything" and merge-equal and add-one
more for "different" values.
If there's more than one field value option, prefer the "default" one.
Marked as "me".

With more data being moved "into the cloud" for the sake of having it accessible:

  * On our own personal (private?) equipment: phone, tablet, PC, TV, whatever.
  * Online, so we can show off to our friends!
  * For work reasons.

The AHA World was designed to refer to any other data object. Regardless where
it is. If your network allows you to "resolve" it, you're set. You can download
or whatever it. Just like you do now with your "cloud" data.
