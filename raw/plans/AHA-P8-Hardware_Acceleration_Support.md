# Hardware Acceleration Support

There may be great potential in chips supporting indexing or other common
functionality faster (or more energy efficient). Whatever works to speed up
graph queries and computations may be useful here, too.

Maybe given the nature of AHFX that it describes a graph-database, with each
Object having some kind of "title" to describe it: It may actually be
match-compatible with existing language-model creating and digesting code and
tools.

Since many of them already offload quite a bit on GPU co-processor subsystems
(aka "Gamer Graphics Cards"), this should be re-usable for the filesystem too.
I don't see any reason not to.
