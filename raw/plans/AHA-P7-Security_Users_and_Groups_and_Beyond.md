## Security: users and groups.

We could also move this to the filesystem level.
I mean with all data currently stored in LDAP-and-such domain systems, etc.
Dancing Samba.

There's probably a good reason why it hasn't happened yet, but I think it's
worth asking what the network-share filesystem veterans have to chip in here.

I believe it should be possible to depict any current (and future) security
related information in a meaningful way in the object storage world.

If combined with "object spaces" as rulebased-context, something like "Digital
Realms" may automatically appear and form. Ad-hoc or permanent, similar to
moderating/administering an IRC chat (server/network).

Forums and online communities: It's already going towards "common ID providers"
- exchanging Security Objects of some kind between online-but-separated
services.
