Patch gthumb as image viewer/annotation/management tool to support read/write any metadata as xattr key/value storage on the filesystem level.

Should not be too difficult or expensive to add that.

It's also going towards a consistent 21st-centure storage paradigm.
Because currently the world is split.
And it's quite a Spagat.
To say the least.

Then patch Clementine music library and player.
Then patch Thunar, Nautilus, etc - to simply have a "right-click-edit-metadata" UI.
Then patch illaCloud to support xattrs - and by same API abstraction - any other key/value data store.
Therefore being instantly "object storage paradigm" capable.
