## Content disagreements and conventions

Anything goes.
I'm just pretty sure we'll all (including you) will find it all way more fun and way less stress to simply adhere to some naming-conventions for starters.

dublin core to begin with.
Nothing new.

If there's more than one title for an object: keep both.
Since it doesn't matter anymore which application or system environment anyone is using to edit and enrich the(ir) data, it pays off to every now and then (especially in the beginning) to provide "better" (meta)data.

Since file-formats and container-formats may be resolved into filesystem objects, and it's easy to implement support for opening "graphs" by double-clicking or loading an "entry object".

Since any "name=" can be occuring [0..n] times (name1, name2, name3, ...), coexisting with different values, it's easily possible to have even "disagreeing" information.
And for the same reason, a digital signature could be stored like "name3=<sig>", and the user could decide (like https) if they "trust it".

Standards may be used to provide naming conventions, relationship and annotation rules, etc. Each object may now link easily contain links to xsd, xslt, etc.
