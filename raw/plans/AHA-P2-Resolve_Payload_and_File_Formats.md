## Resolve Payload and file formats

Now the embedded metadata was copied to (new or existing) data objects, you can
now see either with a library-view (like your music player) or like a graph.
Even if a folder hierarchy, if you prefer that.

The AHFX allows to dissolve multi-data container formats into individual
objects, referring to each other in a context.

So your initial conversion/copy is leaving a relationship-graph with some
"light" objects and "heavy" objects.

  * **light objects:**
    lightweight, mostly text-only, a few bytes to kB, possibly growing in the future.

  * **documents:**
    semi. Usually kilobytes, maybe megabytes - possible growing in the future.

  * **heavy objects:**
    That's what we now call "a large file". Like a high-res videofile or so. Or a holo-matrix.

That relationship graph is stored in data objects on the filesystem. You can
view and interact with these "files" as you are used to. A main new feature is,
that you can interact more directly with the relationships and metadata fields.
It's all right-click-whatever. Or long-touch. :P

Any payload data format (image, audio, video, document, construction or prototype plans, anything) can be translated to a related Object Graph.

So any file format can be depicted (=converted to) an Object Graph of equivalent features.

The handling-overhead (interpreting links to related Objects, and finding the
right (meta)code to make that "Graph Format" to come alive.

Basically, reading - and interpreting and Object could be considered the same
effort as "guessing nowadays" what to do when double-clicking "an icon image"
of some kind. :D

Contain the same information - and be generous, yet not too-chaotic. As
structured and annotated as reasonable for each case.

Imagine you could now "look at" the structure of any Digital Data, by having
your Object Browser "render" (in 3D or even VR if you will) - depicting the
relationships and attributes (relationships resolved as pleased, configured or
simply profiled)
