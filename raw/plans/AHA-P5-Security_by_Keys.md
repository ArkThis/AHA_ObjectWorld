## Security by keys. Public/Private.

It's about time, that this was resolved.
If anyone likes to, they can attach their gpg-public-key (and/or link) and signature and whatever to an object.

So anyone who edits/alters/creates an object, may leave their signature.
Add block-chain storage to this, and interesting things become easily possible.

Due to the "feelable" virtually-tangible object nature of this design, it may even be inviting to use "your private key" to access objects.
Good question is, how do you "provide" that key when needed?

I don't like the "obviously well-known" *eyeball-on-a-pen* entry-hack. At all.
Neither standalone-fingers to start your ... car.

However, integrating gpg and friends to support object storage, may be nice.
We can have group-keys.

Maybe get one automatically when joining any object-space?
One for each space. Meta-Spaces encouraged, of course.
No I don't mean the "FB-Meta".
I'm actually a bit annoyed that I can't use the word "meta" now anymore.
Especially these days.

Anyways:
Imagine you can simply wave your badge (as you do in-house), or type in a password - and decide how long this "login" will be valid, when you enter an object space.

This may also be used as auto-reminder if you remain in a digital space for "longer than intended or expected". Of course, inaction-timers can be set independently, etc.
