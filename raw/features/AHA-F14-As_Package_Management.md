## May replace Package Management functionality.

Where do you get your executables from?

Package repositories, similar to existing functionality of existing Linux
distributions (Debian, Arch, etc), could be accessed by metadata stored with
Objects.

Also the packages themselves could be converted to Object Graphs. Making
currently different package managers be able to "cherry-pick" and handle any
kind of package for installation and setup. Would also support AppImage,
Flatpak, etc.
