## May provide build-from-tar recipes (ArchLinux Style).

Imagine you find "a digital object" laying around on a USB stick.
Hm.
What do you do?

In my AHA world, I just double-click (or dot-slash) it.
What would happen?

I'm running my AHA stack on some future-alien-technology-hardware-3000.
Still running something that can run - or build GNU/Linux code.

Then the ArchLinux Pacman-style recipe information should be sufficient to make my host system download, install, build - then install again - whatever I need to work with "that data object".

And if something in the build-chain or environment is borken or missing, it should be rather trivial (compared to now) to deal with it: Even if the pacman and tarball code doesn't compile or work out of the box: This can be debugged.
And if one is lucky, there was also a link to a pre-built binary somewhere.
Why not? ;P

Anyways: This would seriously make data more fun to play and work with.


What reason would speak against downloading and translating a recent ArchLinux distribution release into related Data Objects, which could boot-from-scratch any FOSS application you like.

Out of thin air.
Quasi.
