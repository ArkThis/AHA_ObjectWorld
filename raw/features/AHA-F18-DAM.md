## DAM features may be replaced by plugins/views for a Object browser.

Modern DAMs are already web-browser based. Front- as well as back-end.  Now if
the database "is already there" - because it's your filesystem - any DAM
functionality should be made as "website plugin" for your data browser.

Why bother to have an extra program for annotating files - and have search
queries to access them?

## May replace the backend database for any digital asset management system.
