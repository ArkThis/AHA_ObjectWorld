## FINDEMICH

[Imagine a cheesy 90s TV-sales-show style]
Does this sound familiar - to you?!:
> I want to find my stuff.
> I know it's "there somewhere".

Well?
You do know something, do you?
Maybe:
Date? Title? Author? Any memory? Any term? Any related thing?

**Here's a text-field.**

Any recording device or software or tool may add its (technical or descriptive
or elaborate) metadata next to the created file. The whole recording process
(including project-files, takes, etc) is stored in related objects. There
actually is no more such thing as "a project file format". A "project-file" is
merely an entry-object that is related to all the stuff previously stored in a
program-specific file/folder structure.o

Any application used to edit the file could leave a commit-message or remark.
Since the object IDs default syntax is designed as "collision-friendly globally
persistent ID", any reference (if not manifested or resolved) could very well
be found "somewhere" in a common object filesystem network.

Like the "AHA world".

This would also mean, that Linked Open Data is also built-in by design.  When
copying to the long-term archival storage, you can simply select "a profile" -
and all the references of your object(s) are resolved, and used to create the
right archival package and enough environmental data (other packages/objects)
until OAIS is checked with "yes" ;)

You can even go as crazy as fetching the embedded hardare configuration over
SNMP and store that 1:1 as an object graph. Bi-directionally.
