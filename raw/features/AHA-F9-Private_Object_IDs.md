## Private Object IDs

Like localhost or LAN address spaces "reserved" to be discarded when leaving a certain domain.
Object spaces are one thing.

It can make sense to define some object IDs to mark as "seriously private".
Like `🌟️M20230816...`

Any code by any developer should respect that "M-prefix" and make sure to
discard M-prefix Objects if encountered "out of private". As a courtesy of the
housekeeper ;)

Should one consider making a private-ID object, you can simply copy/paste it
over and assign it a new, regular ID.  It may give you the hint that you're
"de-privatizing" that object, which you confirm. Done.  It really *is* that
simple.
