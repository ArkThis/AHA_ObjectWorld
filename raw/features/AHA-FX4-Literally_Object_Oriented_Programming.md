## May dissolve programming code into filesystem objects.

Who would be so crazy to consider this?
Hm... WhatIf.

If you translate program code from "objects in text files" to "objects on the filesystem", even storing each function as separate object: What would this change?

Applying a doxygen-style render webpage as data browser plugin, one could not only browse through the code like through the HTML docs, but whatif one's also a creator and "hacks" the code? In the most amazing ways? :)

It would be interesting if that would have an effect on how code libraries usage and handling?
What if each source-code-function object now comes with its binary (executable) version?

Ignoring any possible performance or hardware-requirement doubts:
WhatIf each "code object" could be executed natively?
Because it was "described" and related well enough to provide the right data graph and payload.

When I consider IDEs: Integrated Development Environments for professional code manufacturing, I imagine it being a relief to see all the IDE-and-build-and-language-environment-specific-gazillion-detail-settings dissolve into configuration object-graphs. Then it's not a shame anymore to "not find the config option I know exists".
