## Store eMails as related Objects

Imagine: Each email is stored as Object. All metadata simply attached to it.
Folder structures: As metadata tags and as meta-objects, grouping all contained Objects (eMails) within.

Configuration of the eMail accounts:
Also stored as related Objects on your storage.
Just like any other data laying around.
Imagine, you could simply backup these eMail Objects "by Query" - and restore them, usable immediately - after re-indexing - by your eMail client program.

There is no difference between "exported" data from your eMail client program, and the actual data Objects stored on your drive. The eMail application merely needs to cache/index this "eMail Pool" of Objects.

There is no big difference anymore (technically) between a textfile and an email. Merely additional metadata and related Object (graph) structure is provided. Yet, this could also be applied to any other file format - so also you textfile.

You may literally use *any* AHFX-compatible Object Browser to interact with your emails - almost as natively and fluently as with your common Thunderbird. Because viewing your "(Message) Objects" sorted in a tree-like display, based on properties - stored on the filesystem as "meta" with each "data" (message)?

All the same.
Basic LEGO.


### Update: This is probably already done using "Data Lake" systems.

Quote from [SAS Company Blog](https://www.sas.com/en_us/insights/articles/data-management/what-is-a-data-lake-and-why-does-it-matter-.html):

I'm pretty sure if not done already, it might be interesting to support AHFX as base engine of instant messengers. They might suddenly become more interoperable, by adding Transformer-Objects to those Object-Message network(s): Having technical and content metadata easily accessible by the same libs in the same manner, may resolve even boundaries to other messaging/information systems:

Where is the technical difference between an e-mail (message) and a short-message and an instant-message - or a posting on a board or in an app?

If you can imagine any of such messages in a Data Object form (meta+data, name=value, payload, ID): Where can you draw the differences between these "applications" and protocols?
