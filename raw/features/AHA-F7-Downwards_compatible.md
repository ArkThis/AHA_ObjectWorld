## Seamlessly (downwards-)compatible to file/folder naming workflows and applications.

In AHFX, your data objects will be "called to life" whenever you copy a path or a file over to your "AHA world". You will then "see" and handle your "files" the way you're used to:

  * Folder structure
  * Filename
  * Timestamps, access rights, etc.

But now these metadata fields are stored on the AHFX object filesystem layer. Using the very basic and intergalactic uber-standard, just like "plain filenames" are now.

Now, you can choose to work with your objects like that, or you can use other "interfaces" (think IIIF.org) to interact with your "digital objects". Technically they are all the same now: They're just "views".

These "views" are to be implemented in a browser-based manner.
I would suggest that, since then all web-proven website code can be re-used here easily.
Your "file manager" would be renamed to "Data browser", or "Habakuck!" or whatever.
Under the hood it'll be a friendly Firefox-fork (like Tor),
