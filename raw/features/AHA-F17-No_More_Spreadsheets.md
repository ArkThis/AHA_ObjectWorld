## May replace the necessity for spreadsheets index files.

Using spreadsheet applications (eg LibreOffice, Excel, etc) to create an "index for some collection" comes naturally, when there is no way for properly annotating your work in a consistent and reliable way.

Like we all did and do with filenames and the quest for the right foldername.

If there was a way to actually put the metadata right with the digital object it's talking about:
Why even bother using another application?
You just put the metadata in a right-click-whatever interface, and off you go!


Similar to "why embed metadata" when you can just edit-and-use it conveniently "with your Objects on a plain-text level"?
