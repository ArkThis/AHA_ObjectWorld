## May contain duplicate entries for the same "name=value" pair.

On any level.

If you think about an XML or JSON dataset, hierarchies, tree structured values.
AHFX should allow duplicate entries with the same "name=", even if they're on the same "level" on a branch.

Deal with "too much duplicates" later.
There's probably some pattern (to use for filtering and transformation).

Either create Mapping Objects (Translators/Transformers/Interpreters) that you can "plug-in" to map possible candidates in an m-to-n (m:n) relationship. Implemented by related Objects on your filesystem.

Yes, the filesystem is a kind of databank already: Why not use the upped ressources of our currently wasteful IT, and be serious and use *the filesystem* as *the database*. Thank you.
