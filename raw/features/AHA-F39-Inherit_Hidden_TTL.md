# Properties of anything are inherited by "sub-folders".

Can we please move on calling it "folders" and "path" - but something else, that it actually is:
It's just information. It's structured, 1-dimensional units to group things by.

And the syntax is:

/this/is/a/path.

And:

/this/is/my/home/photos/collection/2020/08

And:

This is me, regretting I've started sorting by "month".
I'll never do that again.

But now I'm not re-doing all my hard work to put all my files in subfolders.
Just to kill me when synchronizing with the phones again - and then I have the original filenames as duplicates all over.
A mess.

If only...?

In fact, if the filename and path would simply "be put in yet-another metadata field as xattr", there could be more than 1 at the same time.





# IDEA: Hidden keys.

Maybe allow a syntax in the key-name to distinguish between "visible and hidden" alias hardcopies showing up "somewhere else".
(They are not somewhere else. Don't worry. Everything is where it should be.)

> Your data never was in any folder ever.

It never moved.
Imagine a path being a tag-tree of terms.
You simply can now describe your object from multiple points of views:
Assigning zero-or-more nested taxonomy terms.
In parallel.

Same for the filename.
Just keep it and add another one.


# IDEA: syntax for tagging key-names TTL.?

Could be useful.
But seems more like an optional feature, yet handy.

Basically for garbage collection.
Maybe it's great for "letting go of data by tagging it TTL>0".

It works exactly like the trashbin-metaphor on the Desktop UIs,
