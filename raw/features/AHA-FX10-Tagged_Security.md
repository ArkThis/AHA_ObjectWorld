## Security as an option. And a tag.

Imagine the linux multi-desktop metaphor, and think of them as "object spaces".
You can create as many object-spaces as you like (and your system can handle, of course).
Right click-new. "type=space; title=Home". Done.

There will probably be some sane defaults, well-supported conventions and of course proper standards. All living alongside each other.

Object spaces may be sub-spaces of other object spaces.
And of course, since they're AHA objects, they may be related to other Objects.

Now when you switch your "Linux-Object-Desktop" (Ctrl+Alt+Left/Right), you switch your object storage space working context:

In that "context" (=object space & its (transition) rules), can you access the "data objects" you'd like to work/interact with - or merely enjoy or share?

If you open your "data browser" (=like your beloved file manager), you can either access ("see" or read or edit) the objects you're looking for - or not.

If you want to access "out of space" objects in your pools (can be local as well as remote), rules like this may be applied automatically:

  * Objects marked "private" must never leave "private" space. Unless intentionally said so.
  * You may use any tags to quickly "mark" any object(-tree) or context: And query them for filtering.
  * You may add transition (eg transcoding) recipes and scripts (=other objects) to be executed when being accessed between object spaces.

Within one object-space: All things are equal. Just tagged differently.
But you may access anything, that's in the space you're in.

That's your level of security:
Feels more like the real world.
And you can shape it.

Local and network security administration is fun again!
