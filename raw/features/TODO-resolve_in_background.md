# Idea: a background task (optional) to resolve "embedded to xattrs". Even of hashtags.

@date: 2025-07-16

Have an indexer-like configured application search for certain things in all kinds of files - and if it finds them worth "looking for or noteworthy" - that tool copies-and-keeps that info as xattrs.

As Object Metadata.

  * write "search term" with object being read.
    The equivalent to "atime" for metadata: "By what term was I referenced as - and from where? (context)?"

  * Hashtags or other syntax-highlit structural concepts and terms shall be moved to xattrs.

  * Embedded/in-file metadata vs xattrs: Who is "right" if they disagree?
    To be clarified and tested - per environment.
    Good practice would be to have a flag - as xattr that decides the preference /for that object/.
    At some point, admin (=owner of object) knows best.
    And it may more easily be "fixed" when xattr vs embedded.
    And: Both versions may be offered for search queries - and switches for by-search preference too.
    This may seem complicated, but it's simple.

Running such a "scraper" in the background - or on demand or events - would auto-improve your datas viability and searchability.

Optionally resolving file-format into related-annotated filesystem objects.
Or removing outdated objects, or others matching "own data-housekeeping rules"?
How nice.
Reorganizing certain topics, query-matches, groups of objects here and there: Assign backup and failover-distribution by drag-and-drop or commandline. Always the same: mostly basic filesystem operations and GNU and FOSS tools.


Anyways:
Here is the place to collect scraper and data-reorganizer demon ideas, given AHAlodeck filesystem capabilities.
Most is possible if at least basic xattrs + object IS addressing works. Which is rather low-hanging fruit to implement.
Performance tests will show the limits currently - and its scalability on the fly: local /and/ cloud - same-same. On the filesystem frontends.

Your storage de-embedding metadata by default on "incoming copy events"?
Or doing the same for external media, but storing the "filesstem metadata" where?
Concepts of metadata-server networks exist for filessystems (ceph?), but I've also heard about the single-point-of-failure issues with such a concept.

Therefore data-atomicity and truths of inter-related data can only be guaranteed "so far so good". I believe this is a known "fact by tech nature of its design", that you may have "at other times valid" values for a given key to a certain object ID.

Considering this to be a normal (not an error) case, and handling merges and eventual conflicts (which rarely happen on writable filesystems).


This is enterprise-world-sales approved tech.
It works. That much.

And SELinux uses xattrs for security information. So it's that serious - and stable - too.
