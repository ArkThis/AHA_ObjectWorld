## Security: Different "object spaces" - from private to public to anywhere.

There can be any number of "object spaces".
Think of it like chat-rooms or "contexts" or whatever.
Not all Object browsers can have all features implemented - but as with current computing, there are often "common basics" that one can assume to have as common or fallback option to interface with IT.

Oh, btw: Each object space is merely "yet another Object".

Because most configuration options for anything can now actually be stored with a Object. No more registry, no more config files.

And config files will dissolve into annotated and related objects anyways.


This may be closely related to the concept of "Realms" I've written about in another section.
