# We're done with Playmobil. Give us the LEGO.

We've by far outgrown the Playmobil IT-design possibilities.
Even Duplo would fit better now. But I'm pretty sure we could either do that or
go and switch to LEGO alltogether.

I think the success of Minecraft kind of proves my point here :D



Instead of piling up "as-is" computing components, rather offer computing
"Digital Data" a Technic-Lego metaphor again. To literally play with.
Personally as well as professionally.

Match VR ontop of that, and you're sold.
