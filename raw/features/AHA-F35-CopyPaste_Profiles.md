## Copy/Paste (and Profiles)

Whenever you'd like to copy/paste an object, the application you've chosen to interact with that object will handle copy/paste preference profiles.

They're quite cool.

And it's very important, that there are widely supported sane defaults for these profiles, and also regional or fun deviations easily possible.

When I copy my whatever collection to an external disk, I may be asked:
> "External drive: Which profile would you like to apply?"

And you can choose between something like:

  * My choices
  * Music collector
  * Private
  * Public
  * Professional EN15907 FIAF
  * <downloadlink>
  * <downloadlink>
  * <downloadlink>
  * <downloadlink>
  * etc.

btw: That "collection" I copied was the search result of a clever query I made. Showing up in a graph-y rendered IIIF browser. In my default data browser.
So I already could use my data browser for catalog use-cases.

It's probably sane to ask once; eg with checkbox with "don't ask me again, assume my default answer." - and only have the profile-choice pop-up on certain conditions - or when a certain key is held. Like "Ctrl+Whatever+DragnDrop" to trigger a certain profile (or a dialog window).
