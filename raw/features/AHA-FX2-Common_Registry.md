## May replace (necessity for) conventional config files.

This shall be better, but in good spirit of "The Windows Registry", knowing and
loving: `/etc`.

How many config files does the average GNU/Linux command have?
None, one - and sometimes a folder or more. But usually (if), then *one*.

So why not put that config information right with the exectuable "file"?
(Since that "exec file" is now also an object, ready to hold metadata. Any.)

Right-click-whatever to view/edit/configure your program.


What about the Windows Registry metaphor and usage?
Storing these "config blocks" as related Objects in the filesystem would
resolve both worlds - UNIX-ish and Windows onto a common software and library
stack.

Perfectly interoperable.
And find-and-access any configuration of anything "by a search query" - and store all settings as nested key-value pairs in the filesystem.

"...in the filesystem"

Starts getting boring?
Or starts becoming clear, how playing with Lego Objects instead of complex binary formats simplifies a lot of use-cases by its nature.
