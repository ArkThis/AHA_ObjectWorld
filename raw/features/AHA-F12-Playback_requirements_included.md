## May provide links to editing/playback/view requirements

Imagine you receive a "copy of whatever.xyz" from a friend or anyone else:
How do you open it?
It's common courtesy for anyone to at least (if they can) provide a link where I
can download the right stuff to access this file. To watch it, to listen, to
read - to create, anything.

Like:
  * "application=vlc"
Or:
  * "encoding=h264"
