## May work even more awesome with IIIF.

I imagine the data browser to be a friendly awesome-FOSS-web-browser fork (like Firefox/Tor), running "object-fields to IIIF manifest code".

  * Implement default file manager functionality in an open web standard.
  * Implement all data-views of any kind in the same way.
  * Examples:
    * Image viewer
    * Annotator
    * Video player
    * Music player
  * Handle relationships to other objects (of other types, etc)

Assuming that the mainstream trends currently are towards "all in a browser engine app" - this may not be the most efficient (energy, etc) wise way, but it'd work well.

I'm not sure if it's actually better to support generating IIIF manifest on the fly, based on whatever data comes with the objects, compared to IIIF actually on the long-term moving away from manifest to native object-speak. That might also be an interesting option.
