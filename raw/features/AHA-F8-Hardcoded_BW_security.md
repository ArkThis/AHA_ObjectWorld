## Hardcoded black/white security:

private/public.

that's it.
You wanted digital, here it is: Either yours or theirs.
;)

Yet, of course the AHFX implementation specification clearly encourages anyone to add more "object spaces", yet I'd ask you to at least hardcode-hardcore respect private/public as good as you can. In code and spirit.

Have respect.
Anything marked private is off limits.
Anything marked public is as good as gone out into the wild! Anything can happen.

Yes, you can add additional so called "object spaces" to group access conditions.
You can create a new object space, by right-click-new then drag-n-drop whatever you want to assign this to. Done.
