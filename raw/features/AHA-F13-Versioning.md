## May cover file/data versioning needs.

If any versioning metadata would be stored in proper  layout, the object
layer could be used to store interoperable versioning information.

Check out how Git does it, and maybe patch Git to support the Object Storage
default features.


UPDATE: I'm pretty sure MinIO (and other S3 storages) already cover/support
this stable.

It makes perfect sense to do that on the filesystem-level, too.

Is GIT or any other versioning system already "Object"-compatible?
