## DSGVO: Tagged.

Object relationships or queries can be marked as "DSGVO-compliant or not".
Or like: "public / private. Done."

The data will simply not show up where it's not supposed to.
Because it got "filtered out" on the way all the time anyways.
Each object space may have its different graph-rulesets, and that is encouraged.

If there are any "disagreements" over anything, anyone is always free to "fork off".
In a friendly way. Hopefully.

Websites will merely be a web-frontend for a huge collection of stored, annotated objects.
In order to "leak" data, one would have to corrupt each individual host and application involved in accessing the sensible data.

If any application is told by filesystem-rules that "this object is not what you're looking for" - then it's simply dropped and discarded - and maybe (optionally) bit-shredded in memory.
