## Security performance: Relationship matters.

> Security by web-of-trust. Again.

Excellent.
For example:
When you "open" (=load) a movie from its archival "image-sequence plus extra files" folder copy, the performance is hindered by having to check access rights for each frame.

In the AHA-world, (local, default) security policies could use the relationship/lookup-hops like:

"If you are allowed to open this movie (meta-)object, than you're also of course free to access ... whatever's related in a certain way."

Not just recursion-depth, but real graph-data-queries (if performance allows, but things could probably be cached or pre-processed).

Such a design may have great positive impact on the performance of access.
