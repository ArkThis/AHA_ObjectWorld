## May replace common parts of workflow management systems.

AHFX can be used to depict any kind of workflow graph.
By design.

Any user interface (application or browser- or web-based) may all access and use the filesystem as database, and each object as its best meta-and-data container.

Relationships supported by standard.
Full URI support - and Objects may be executable. Simply running code either attached as meta, as data - or as related Object/Library.

Basically having a code interpreter that is aware of the Object filesystem features.

Therefore, the filesystem-interpreter standard libraries provide common means
for "running code" from and on Objects.

Any kind of workflow may be depicted in an Object Graph.
PureData and alike are showing how and that this already works for a very long time.

It's now a question of performance - and shifting the challenges to a different paradigm.
Like a Math trick in the real (computing) world.

Simply changing the rules of the game.
And copying data over to "another level."

This is the beauty of digital.
