# AHA - A Holodeck by August

> "But Noone Has Ever Done This Before!"

And that's exactly, why it's gonna work.
Seriously.
:P


# Prototype PT-AHFX: Ideas and Plans.

Why should this work?
If what I say would be true, why doesn't that already exist?
Especially, since I myself say: All the required components exist, FOSS-licensed (!) and global-network, large-scale production stable.


And Google already has the functionality to store metadata tags with files you store in their cloud.
Amazon S3 also.
MinIo also.
I think it's "common sense" in the "rather" new Object-Filesystem world to have meta with your data. Finally.

I'm simply observing that most real-world cases of metadata-wrangling and asset-management administration challenges I encounter, are due the current axioms of:

  * There's the file and somewhere else there's the "catalog entry".
  * You may embedd "some" metadata.
  * complex file formats are binary encoded data streams.
  *
