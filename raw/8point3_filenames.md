# Remember 8.3 Filenames?

(2024-01-07 21:18:53)

TODO: Write a short revisiting of 8.3 filenames as "the only thing" - and then swiftly opening to 250+ chars including spaces (!) - and dots anywhere. Even non-ascii characters.

Wow.
Mindblowing!
And now one wouldn't even think twice about not being able to describe a filename like "a pro". Which is good! It's "just there". And it mostly works. Even Umlauts and special characters interoperability issues are almost dying out: Thanks Unicode / UTF-8!

Now I'm suggesting to do exactly the same thing again:
We all simply took our existing file/foldernames (like back from UPPERCASE 8.3 legacy) as-is to "could have longer names now" paradigm. Drag-n-Drop.

And it simply became omnipresent and greatly supported.
Even on the smallest of embedded devices.

Since most people I know already store "some or most" of their digital stuff online in some company's "cloud service". Being able to tag and relate it online (or by app) already. Yet quite vendor-specific.

Yet up until today, given the vast amount of work and labor and minds being put into solving meta-and-data issues daily, globally - by the millions (of tax payer's and private and company money). Billions, I'd bet.

I'd consider that a motivation to consider my proposal:
Putting that effort into designing a professional FOSS licensed system that is publicy funded (ongoing) and first of all designed to be simple name=value filesystem handling environment blocks and libraries.

To make Object features as omnipresent "and just there" like 250+ char filenames are now.
And anyone can simply name-value tag all their stuff offline as well as online.
And simply copy/paste/relate/annotate as you please.

Nice.
