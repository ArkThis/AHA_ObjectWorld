# Abstract

This contains information and links where to find listings of "features" a
well-orchestrated Object Storage environment could offer.

I'll try to keep the texts short for starters, then gradually reveal complexity
and details - and sort them in order of "ease of implementation and/or user
desires/priorities".


# Glossary

  * Object: "Meta and/or Data Object"
  * Object: A data object, as implemented in current state of the art "object cloud storage" storage systems.
  * AHA world: An environment, where the AHFX is supported and implemented beyond any transition stage: This is a well-running object oriented digital environment. The AHA world.
  * AHFX: Name of the "AHA-world Filesystem. X." like ext4 or fat or ahfx.



# Keeping it simple.

> Any musician can play their instruments up to such an old age, because their
> instrument and music gives them live. Both of them at the same time.
>
> A good instrument becomes part of the one who plays it.
> A good instrument may also be used, studied, shared and improved by any
> artist and maker who desires to.

**May computing become `an instrument` again.**

An orchestra of individuals playing with related Data Objects surrounded by
Code. Also related Objects.
Languages of different kinds describing the Nature of Digitally Stored Memories.
Data and Applications.

In the most amazing, yet even happy-to-be-boring-and-stable variations one can imagine.

The subfolder [features](features/) provides a collection of
"first-come-first-written.md" feature designs and possible popular use-cases of
metadata wrangling and embedded-metadata and container format handling.


# Overview of Plans

"first-come-first-written.md" additional ideas and possible popular use-cases of

> AHA! AHAlodeck. It's like comparing pears and apple.
