# AHA: A Holodeck by August - Reloaded (2024-01-01)

## Refer to 8.3 filenaming as "the standard"

## Refer to "How Win+Mac+Linux just did it" - and we now don't even think about "long filenames" anymore.

## Collission-Friendly Object IDs.

## Data guarding by design / in tags.

## Network QoS and routing: same. tags.

## Hardware support

Yes, Object-Handling in hardware support. Chips for that.
BIOS functions in simple, and reliable module form.

Like there were "network cards" back then - and maybe later there's a "Holodeck Chip" on board. By default.

Takes less energy to mold, build and support "one lego set" - rather than re-mold everything again all the time.

## Object Storages: Necessary anyways.

## All of us are "doing it" already, anyways.

How do you "organize" your digital doings?

Mixed. I see.
Me too.
Yeah... It works.

Too lazy to get up and check the back of your monitor to get the model number? They don't print it on the fronts anymore. anything.

Anyways:
You're doing it anyways: Checking your online-whatever accounts(!) plural - for whatever you "need" or "want" right now.
Or whatever pinged you.

Anyways:
You're already interacting with "cloudy objects" in a Holodeck-implementation base.

One question:

## Would you think storing "The Youtube Collection" in a classical - still considered "professional" files-in-folders filesystem?

And then "just add a fancy web-based frontend to a database"?

WhatIf they're already "just storing Objects" - and you're browsing and interacting with them all the time when you do online shopping or facebooking or whatever.


## MinIO setup in 5 minutes:
