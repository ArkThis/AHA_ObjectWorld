# So here is what I understood an Object Storage *is*:

Around 2022, I understood.

  * A way to store data as a digital "Object", accessible by an Object ID.
  * File- and foldernames, paths and file-extension become Object Metadata.
    Stored as part of "The Object" as meta+data. accessible by an Object ID.

  * Meta and Data may (primarily for performance and access reasons) possibly in different ways).
    Also regarding scalability.

  * Scalable from single-disk-single-node to multi-everything-failover-banks-hospital-military-broadcast-preservation-grade stable and huge. By design and practical experiences.

  * Scalable from many-many small to many-many super-large. Anything goes.

  * This technology is professionally *the goto data storage option* for
    * Big Data
    * Internet service providers of anything.
    * AI learning and stuff
    * random access annotated data graphs
    * large semi-to-unstructured meta+data
    * As base for making that data query-able (SQL, Sparql, etc)


So I'm professionally assuming that the use-cases in GLAM (and I mean almost *any*) should easily be cover-able by any company providing the above mentioned storage-and-data-management "environment" for that, should serve us well into a new age of digital preservation - and all DAM/MAM/CMS in all small-medium-large-and-beyond collection environments.

Especially small-medium-large-and-beyond businesses.

Yet, by dissolving the actual interoperability "borders" between data - and all its processing components, there will be great impact on "the economy" of all things data: because it'll transform from playmobil to lego, making things not only waaaaaay easier, but also cheaper - and longer-lasting, because more "fixable" - because Data environments are lego now.

Therefore, it may be a real option to reconsider taken-for-granted business and society - especially job models.
If we have a digital bubble bursting, why not in the favor of everyone - instead of "the usual few".

This will benefit *anyone*.
Unless the only thing you're looking for is puppet-master power and control.


This will benefit *anyone*.
Resolving file-format headers and structure into "regular filesystem data objects" that can be viewed, based on search queries and profile/presets.
