# Think in "Bookmarks".

 #showntell 2024-09-03


Do a show-and-tell live-show of:
"WhatIf your files were (as easy to handle as) "Bookmarks?""

**A live-Demo using Firefox (or any other browser's bookmark) as a file manager**

Seriously: If you add search-by-relationship-metadata to a bookmark manager, you'll get the most awesome one-size-fits-most LEGO-handling of digital data user interface.
For both, commandline and graphical interfaces. Even APIs.

We'll go from "saving a simple bookmark" - duh!
To "wow. can someone now please tell anyone to stop what they're doing and listen to this guy?! He may come from the Future, MArty!"

(Or the past, because he ain't using Emojis properly.)

Enjoy.


------------------


# Can you show me the picture of ...?

Just kidding.
Please don't.
I'd like to invite you to take the journey to:

> You've actually forgotten that it ever had been 'a question' how to import/export "metadata".
> Like noone does "8.3 ASCII-only filenames" - or even knows about it anymore.


Imagine you have "data stored somewhere..."

Sorry, I should ask first.



## Do you have "data stored somewhere"?

  * Can you show me?
  * Anything? Any file of any format?
  * How?
  * Can I see it on my system, too?


But before that: "What's in it for ME?"


# Do you do email or messaging?

WhatIf you could use your email program as file-manager and annotation tool?
For real. Private and professional.

For more than 20years successfully now, and ongoing support - no
updates/changes necessary once the base code was "stable".

We'll get back to that later, and I promise you a biiiiig smile... *waitforit*
Because imagine your emails being a collection of "bookmarks with a body". So:

WhatIf you could use your *bookmark* manager as file-manager and annotation tool?

This question will make more sense, after you've read this:


# A bookmark is a file in folder.

What do you believe to be true?

  * A bookmark is information?
  * A bookmark is "a link with metadata"?
  * A bookmark is "a Data Object"?
  * A "file" could actually be yet-another "Data Object"?

> **Now just "save" it?**

Yes. "Bookmark saved".
Thanks! Doctor...?!

Seriously. it's a book-mark in a browser.
Just do it.

Saved.


## How hard can it be?

Saving a "bookmark".

For starters:

  * Do you know you have enough "space" to save it?
  * Do you have permission to do so?
  * Does "your" application give you means to do so?
  * Do you know "where" you saved it - so you can find it later?
  * Do you need to know "where"? or just keywords or related stuff?
  * Have you saved it in a way that is convenient to "share" with others?
  * And receive data from others that way?
  * Do you have permission and (network) access?
  * Should you?

How do you retrieve that "Object" when you want/need to?
Now, later?
Or anyone else for that matter.

Filename?
Foldername?
Structure, syntax, numbers, patterns, filetypes, standards - proceed?

Oh. Migration problems - I see...
I feel you there.
What if we'd actually not allow-and-pay-and-applaude nonsense-procedures that everyone suffers from - and rather embrace a completely new idea of:

**Playmobil was okay, but we've grown out of it, thank you. LEGO please.
Preferred handed-on from generation to generation.
Compatibility connecting generations in emotions and experiences**

If you ain't given the bookmark any "additional" metadata, you can by-default, simply query for:

  * A date (fuzzy syntax)
  * Full-text search in: title, html-(text)content? comment, tags.

This is pretty much it, and very practical and sufficient for quick day-to-day "data handling".

Annotation/Context:

  * Timestamp of creation is saved by default.
  * It has a "title" information.
  * It has a "link" information.
  * It may have a "comment" (free text) field.

Imagine:

  * Since the "comment" field is "free text" - it may as well be binary encoded information.
  * Therefore consider the "comment" a data field.
  * Let's call it "payload".

Questions:

  * How do you save bookmarks?
  * Like files in folders?
  * Or more "favorite + tags"?
  * Why do you save in folders?
  * How do you choose a filename?

And:

  * How do you deal/handle "file/folder collection" merges?
    Like:
    "Hooray! A friend dropped by and I can copy the whole set of disks!"
    (Data Objects)

  * "...and all the printouts and original boxes that go with it!"
    (Metadata)


So now I'm simply saving "a bookmark".
And all of the save-search-retrieve use-cases described above are satisfied *by default*.
As long as you "have access" to "that group of Objects" - or their metadata - to search/access them.

That's it.
Oh, wait: there's more!

We got links.
We can simply store "related objects".


## So: We got links.

So now we can use that to "relate" Objects to each other. The terminology sounds familiar?
Yes: Handling Related Objects.

This is what this simple "bookmark store" allows us to do.
By allowing meta-Objects, one may even do "m-to-n" relationships - fully annotated with arbitrary "key=value" data.

Simply optimize the computing environments towards seamless and reliable support of these basic features, and support it for as long as it is useful.


## As a catalog

Now we can simply describe and relate *any data*. Literally.
To be realistic: Yes, you have "something like XML/JSON" on anything you usually hit "Save" on - every once in a while.

And you search and retrieve to "use it".

Browser bookmark managers don't (yet, AFAIK) support "related bookmarks" beyond being in the same folder, or having common properties.

However, it is technically trivial to support interpreting links to "other Data Objects".
In fact, anything you from now on work with you simply behave like "an empowered Bookmark!"

All meta+data is accessible "like files, but better!" - by any application alike.


# To be done?

Free access to *any* metadata. All on the same level, commonly supported - and expected - by default.
Common filesystems support it already.

In the [ArchWiki Linux](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Extended_attributes#Preserving_extended_attributes), and other articles about "extended file attributes" (xattrs) - the only "criticism" of meta+data on the fileystem level is that: (*drumroll*) - it's not well-supported.

Yet, everyone agrees it'd make total sense to actually "make use of these existing standards" and be good with it.


## Waitforit?

So yes:
Your email-client could store its "emails" as Objects, too:

  * sender
  * rcpt
  * date, etc.
  * other metadata.
  * *your text here*

Same-same.
A bookmark with a bigger comment.

You can now use your email-program (any, thx to standards) - to handle all your digital data like that.
And you can go crazy on tagging and relating messages to each other.


### Messaging.

*waitforit. again?*

Yes: Any message in any messaging program can be stored and handled as any other "Data Object".
Any you can access, use and handle it - all alike.

Messengers support "attaching file".
Since a file is also a Data Object - you can simply mix-and-match all your emails, instant-messages, their attachments, your files, your friends files, anything: A Data Pool. Or a Lake. Or Pond. Or Swamp.

But this is it:
And it works already. Do you think *insert whatever webservice you use daily* - creates "a folder and a filename"?
Okay, yes - they (still) kind of do. but.
Differently.

And this is what I meant by:
I think it's time to say goodbye to "files-in-folders" as the default data storage world idea:
And make it so that we have easy basic "meta+data" filesystem and application support.



# Not over yet?

I wish you pleasant dreams.
Seriously:
Once you have realized what you just heard, - *waitforit*:

You'll understand how to:

  * de-embed embedded metadata.
  * resolve container formats into "related multi-media objects"
  * make "having a spreadsheet to describe a set of files-in-folders" obsolete.
  * make "having a database to describe a set of files-in-folders" obsolete.
  * provide interoperability between offline-and-online data storage, supporting all cloud features.
  * use tagging for any backup-copy plans.



# Not over yet?

Once you have realized what you just heard, - *waitforit*:

You will see your daily doing with "files in folders, databases, spreadsheets and textfiles and images and documents of other kinds and aaaarrrgh!"

Sorry.
War-Wound acting up.


Acting out.
Now it's over.



You're free to enjoy seeing the world very differently now.

> "Enjoy, and please engage in this idea."



-------

# Not over yet?

Once you have understood that you "simply could hit save on anything".

And then relate-and-annotate that "anything" easy and anywhere.
And consistent and stable.

Once you have realized that everyone has been living in a Playmobil computing world.
 - and you have finally found...

Lego.
Or Minecraft.

Or -*waitforit*
this: "AHAlodeck".


Thank you and good evening.
