> Relational databases and other structured data stores use a schema-driven design. This means any data added to them must conform to, or be transformed into, the structure predefined by their schema. The schema is aligned with associated business requirements for specific uses. The easiest example of this type of design is a data warehouse.

> A data lake, on the other hand, uses a data-driven design. This allows for rapid ingestion of new data before data structures and business requirements are defined for its use. Sometimes data lakes and data warehouses are differentiated by the terms schema on write (data warehouse) versus schema on read (data lake).

  * **Schema on write (data warehouse)**:  
 limits or slows ingestion of new data. It is designed with a specific purpose in mind for the data, as well as specific associated metadata. However, most data can serve multiple purposes.

  * **Schema on read (data lake)**:  
 retains the raw data, enabling it to be easily repurposed. It also allows multiple metadata tags for the same data to be assigned.
