## Scope

Source: https://www.w3.org/community/solid/charter/

```
In general, topics that are “in scope” include anything related to enabling affordances for decentralised Web applications to create and use data across decentralised storages in a way that is secure and privacy respecting for individuals and communities. Work items are intended to be compatible with or extend the Architecture of the World Wide Web. These topics include, but not limited to, the following:

    Protocols for the storage, transmission and portability of data.
    Authentication and authorization mechanisms.
    Notifications.
    Query interfaces.
    (Meta)data models that can be used in storages, e.g., policies, data privacy and rights, provenance records and auditing, error messages.
    Profile descriptions for social and software agents.
    Data interoperability: sharing semantics of the content of resources, e.g., data shapes, data portability.
    Service interoperability: sharing semantics on the discovery of actions and access to resources, e.g, web service descriptions, provisioning, portability.
    User interface affordances: the display of data and services in a view.
    Vocabularies providing the necessary semantics for the mechanisms defined within the scope of this group.
    Signing messages.
    Federation, e.g., message passing, trust, data cascading.
    Evaluation tools (software programs or online services) that help determine implementation conformance.
    Publishing test reports and communicating the level of adoption of technical reports.

With the exception of integrating or bridging specifications developed by another active community in an open standards development body that specialises in a particular topic, the Solid Community Group defer the work to the other community.
