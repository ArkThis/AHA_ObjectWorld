## Abstract

How much longer will current RAID techniques persevere? The RAID levels were codified in the late 1980s; double-parity RAID, known as RAID-6, is the current standard for high-availability, space-efficient storage. The incredible growth of hard-drive capacities, however, could impose serious limitations on the reliability even of RAID-6 systems. Recent trends in hard drives show that triple-parity RAID must soon become pervasive. In 2005, Scientific American reported on Kryderâ€™s law, which predicts that hard-drive density will double annually. While the rate of doubling has not quite maintained that pace, it has been close.

## Author

Adam Leventhal (born 1979 in the United States) is an American software engineer, and one of the three authors of DTrace, a dynamic tracing facility in Solaris 10 which allows users to observe, debug and tune system behavior in real time.[1] Available to the public since November 2003, DTrace has since been used to find opportunities for performance improvements in production environments.[2] Adam joined the Solaris kernel development team after graduating cum laude from Brown University in 2001 with his B.Sc. in Math and Computer Science. In 2006, Adam and his DTrace colleagues were chosen Gold winners in The Wall Street Journal's Technology Innovation Awards contest by a panel of judges representing industry as well as research and academic institutions.[3] A year after Sun Microsystems was acquired by Oracle Corp, Leventhal announced he was leaving the company.[4] He served as Chief Technology Officer at Delphix from 2010 to 2016.[5]

## Abstract

"Three years ago I warned that RAID 5 would stop working in 2009. Sure enough, no enterprise storage vendor now recommends RAID 5. Now it's RAID 6, which protects against 2 drive failures. But in 2019 even RAID 6 won't protect your data. Here's why."
